## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Load the farmersmarket.db and browse its content
- Create a logical data model

<br>
If this is your first time in DB Browser for SQLite, the following instructions may help:

#### 1) Load Database
- Open DB Browser for SQLite
- Go to File > Open Database
- Navigate to your farmersmarket.db 
	- This will be wherever you cloned the GH Repo (within the **05_src/sql** folder)
	- ![db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png)

#### 2) Configure your windows
By default, DB Browser for SQLite has three windows, with four tabs in the main window and three tabs in the bottom right window
- Window 1: Main Window (Centre)
	- Stay in the Database Structure tab for now
- Window 2: Edit Database Cell (Top Right)
- Window 3: Remote (Bottom Right)
	- Switch this to DB Schema tab (very bottom)

Your screen should look like this (or very similar)
![db_browser_for_sqlite.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite.png)

#### 3) The farmersmarket.db
There are 10 tables in the Main Window:
1) booth
2) customer
3) customer_purchases
4) market_date_info
5) product
6) product_category
7) vendor
8) vendor_booth_assignments
9) vendor_inventory
10) postal_data

Switch to the Browse Data tab, booth is selected by default

Using the table drop down at the top left, explore some of the contents of the database

<img src="./images/01_the_table_drop_down_at_the_top_left.png" width="200">

Move on to the Logical Data Model task when you have looked through the tables


### Build Logical Data Model

Recall during session 1:

I diagramed the following four tables:
- product
- product_category
- vendor
- vendor_inventory

 <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_logical_model_partial.png" width="500">


#### Prompt 1:
Choose two tables and create a logical data model. There are lots of tools you can do this (including drawing this by hand), but I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). 



A logical data model must contain:
- table name
- column names
- relationship type

Please do not pick the exact same tables that I have already diagrammed. For example, you shouldn't diagram the relationship between `product` and `product_category`, but you could diagram `product` and `customer_purchases`.

**HINTS**:
- You will need to use the Browse Data tab in the main window to figure out the relationship types.
- You can't diagram tables that don't share a common column
	- These are the tables that are connected
	- <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_conceptual_model.png" width="600">
- The column names can be found in a few spots (DB Schema window in the bottom right, the Database Structure tab in the main window by expanding each table entry, at the top of the Browse Data tab in the main window)

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 2*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### SELECT
1. Write a query that returns everything in the customer table.
2. Write a query that displays all of the columns and 10 rows from the customer table, sorted by customer_last_name, then customer_first_ name.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### WHERE
1. Write a query that returns all customer purchases of product IDs 4 and 9.
2. Write a query that returns all customer purchases and a new calculated column 'price' (quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty), filtered by customer IDs between 8 and 10 (inclusive) using either:
	1.  two conditions using AND
	2.  one condition using BETWEEN

<div align="center">-</div>

#### CASE
1. Products can be sold by the individual unit or by bulk measures like lbs. or oz. Using the product table, write a query that outputs the `product_id` and `product_name` columns and add a column called `prod_qty_type_condensed` that displays the word “unit” if the `product_qty_type` is “unit,” and otherwise displays the word “bulk.”

2. We want to flag all of the different types of pepper products that are sold at the market. Add a column to the previous query called `pepper_flag` that outputs a 1 if the product_name contains the word “pepper” (regardless of capitalization), and otherwise outputs 0.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### JOIN
1. Write a query that `INNER JOIN`s the `vendor` table to the `vendor_booth_assignments` table on the `vendor_id` field they both have in common, and sorts the result by `vendor_name`, then `market_date`.

***

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 3*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### AGGREGATE
1. Write a query that determines how many times each vendor has rented a booth at the farmer’s market by counting the vendor booth assignments per `vendor_id`.
2. The Farmer’s Market Customer Appreciation Committee wants to give a bumper sticker to everyone who has ever spent more than $2000 at the market. Write a query that generates a list of customers for them to give stickers to, sorted by last name, then first name.
   
**HINT**: This query requires you to join two tables, use an aggregate function, and use the HAVING keyword.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Temp Table
1. Insert the original vendor table into a temp.new_vendor and then add a 10th vendor: Thomass Superfood Store, a Fresh Focused store, owned by Thomas Rosenthal
   
**HINT**: This is two total queries -- first create the table from the original, then insert the new 10th vendor. When inserting the new vendor, you need to appropriately align the columns to be inserted (there are five columns to be inserted, I've given you the details, but not the syntax)

To insert the new row use VALUES, specifying the value you want for each column:  
`VALUES(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5)`

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Date
1. Get the customer_id, month, and year (in separate columns) of every purchase in the customer_purchases table.
   
**HINT**: you might need to search for strfrtime modifers sqlite on the web to know what the modifers for month and year are!

2. Using the previous query as a base, determine how much money each customer spent in April 2022. Remember that money spent is `quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty`.
   
**HINTS**: you will need to AGGREGATE, GROUP BY, and filter...but remember, STRFTIME returns a STRING for your WHERE statement!!

**What values systems are embedded in databases and data systems you encounter in your day-to-day life?**

Consider, for example, concepts of fariness, inequality, social structures, marginalization, intersection of technology and society, etc.


```



The article “When Databases Get to Define Family” reveals how digital systems embed moral assumptions about identity and legitimacy. Pakistan’s national ID database, designed to modernize recordkeeping, requires every citizen to be linked to two married parents. What seems like a technical rule becomes a statement about what counts as a valid life. This pattern is not unique to one country. Many databases encountered in daily life, quietly enforce similar expectations of normality.
Data systems appear neutral, yet each field reflects decisions about whose realities are valid. Online forms demand permanent addresses, binary gender options, or family names, assuming stable households and heteronormative structures. When a person’s circumstances do not match these assumptions, the system resists recognition. Efficiency then disguises exclusion. What is omitted from data—fluid families, non-binary identities, informal housing—reveals the limits of fairness as defined by design. Institutional databases often claim to promote fairness or transparency, but fairness is restricted to what can be measured. Health records, for instance, usually record only “male” or “female,” erasing transgenders. Employment or census data simplify complex work arrangements, ignoring informal or unpaid labor. Fairness, in this sense, means equal treatment within an unequal framework: being counted only if one fits the template.
Such biases usually stem from inherited administrative habits rather than deliberate prejudice, but their ethical impact cannot be ignored. Groups do not fit established categories become invisible in policy and research. Public health datasets rarely capture undocumented residents or people without stable housing; when they are absent from statistics, they are also absent from public priorities. A missing record translates into moral neglect.
Databases also express unequal power relationships. Individuals constantly provide personal information to governments, universities, or private platforms yet have little control over its interpretation or reuse. Those institutions define the categories and own the infrastructure. Even systems claiming to empower users—student dashboards, health apps—measure participation through narrow metrics such as login counts or appointment compliance. These quantifications reward certain behaviors and penalize others, establishing quiet hierarchies of worth.
Marginalization through data often occurs through simplification. Populations labeled “other” or “non-specified” lose individuality and political visibility. Migrants, racialized minorities, and people with disabilities are statistically present but analytically invisible. Algorithms trained on such biased data reproduce the same exclusions. Predictive tools for credit, hiring, or health risk turn historical inequality into automated judgment. A neighborhood once classified as “high risk” remains stigmatized because fairness is defined statistically, not socially.
Another concern is the authority of the record itself. Once information enters a system, it gains permanence and legitimacy. Errors or outdated categories are difficult to correct because systems privilege consistency over flexibility. Bureaucratic responses like “the system doesn’t allow it” illustrate how technical constraints become moral barriers. When exceptions cannot be processed, human realities are forced to fit computational order.
Ethical data practice therefore depends on how systems define categories in the first place. Neutrality is impossible; every schema reflects social choices. A more just approach requires designing for ambiguity and change—allowing optional fields, open-ended categories, and periodic revision. Databases should adapt as social norms evolve rather than freezing them in code. Participatory design, where affected communities help decide what data matters, can expose blind spots and redistribute authority over representation. The ethics of fairness extends beyond statistical parity to the structure of recognition itself. Equality cannot mean treating every record the same if some lives remain unrecorded or misclassified. Fair systems must be able to represent difference without turning it into error. Flexibility, transparency, and accountability are moral as much as technical principles.
In daily life, people are surrounded by databases. They determine access to healthcare, credit, education, and even movement across borders. Databases should serve people, not define them. As technology becomes more pervasive, the demand for fairness must expand beyond statistical precision to encompass moral imagination—the capacity to see and include what does not fit the template.
